	//   * Search available quotes of the specified symbol from best price to worst price.
	//   * Until the requested volume has been filled, use as much available volume as necessary (up to what is available) from each quote, subtracting the used amount from the available amount.
	// For example, we have two quotes:
	//   {Price: 1.0, Volume: 1,000, AvailableVolume: 750}
	//   {Price: 2.0, Volume: 1,000, AvailableVolume: 1,000}

	//   {Price: 1.0, Volume: 1,000, AvailableVolume: 250}
	//   {Price: 2.0, Volume: 1,000, AvailableVolume: 1,000}
	// And After calling this a second time for 500 volume, the quotes are:
	//   {Price: 1.0, Volume: 1,000, AvailableVolume: 0}
	//   {Price: 2.0, Volume: 1,000, AvailableVolume: 750}
